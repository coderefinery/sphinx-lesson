Markdown transforms
===================

**This is mostly obsolete and unmaintained now that almost everything
is transitioned to MyST-markdown.  If this is important for you, get
in touch and we can revive it.**

To ease the transition from other Markdown dialects (like the one used
in software-carpentry), we implement some transformations in Sphinx
which happen as source preprocessing.
These are implemented in the ``sphinx_lessons.md_transforms`` module
and are implemented using regular expressions, so they are a
bit fragile.

Code fences
-----------

Code fence syntax is translated to CommonMark.  Input::

        ```
        blah
        ```
        {: output}

Output::

        ```{output}
        blah
        ```

Block quotes
------------

Transform CSS styles into MyST directives (implemented as code
fences.  Input::

        > ## some-heading
        > text
        > text
        {: .block-class}

Output::

        ```{block-class} some-heading
        text
        text
        ```

The ``block-class`` is the directive name (we maintain compatibility
with old jekyll-common)

Raw HTML images
---------------

Raw HTML isn't a good idea in portable formats.  Plus, in the old
jekyll formats, bad relative path handling caused absolute paths to be
embedded a lot.  Transform this::

  <img src="/path/to/img.png">

into this::

   ```{figure} /path/to/img.png
   ```

Exclude any possible ``{{ ... }}`` template variables used to
semi-hard code absolute paths.
