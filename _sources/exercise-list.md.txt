# Exercise list

The `exercise-list` directive inserts a list of all exercise and
solution {doc}`directives <directives>` (and maybe more).  This can be
useful as an overall summary of the entire lesson flow, onboarding new
instructors and helpers, and more.

## Usage

MyST:

````
```{exerciselist}```
````

ReST:

```
.. exerciselist::
```

One can give the optional directive arguments to specify lists of
admonition classes to include (default: `exercise`, `solution`,
`exerciselist-include`) or exclude (default:
`exerciselist-exclude`) if you want to (any {doc}`directives
<directives>` which match any `include`, and do not match any
`exclude` are included).  Specify the options this way (ReST):

MyST:

````md
```{exerciselist}
:include: exercise solution instructor-note
:exclude: exclude-this
```

:::{exercise} Exercise title
:class: exclude-this

Exercise content
:::
````


ReST:

```rst
.. exerciselist::
   :include: exercise solution instructor-note
   :exclude: exclude-this

.. exercise:: Exercise title
   :class: exclude-this

   Exercise content
```

This feature is new as of early 2022, there may be possible problems
in it still - please report.  Currently, only sphinx-lesson
admonitions can be included due to technical considerations (see
source for hint on fixing).

## Recommendations to make a useful list

- Context is important!  Give your exercises a name other than the
  default of "Exercise", so that someone quickly scanning the exercise
  list can follow the overall flow.

  - Making good summaries is really an important skill for organizing
    anything - give this the attention it needs.
  - Think of an exercise leader or helper coming to help someone, seeing
    the exercise, and needing to help someone: not just what to do,
    but what the core lesson and task is, so that they can focus on
    giving the right help (and telling the learners what they don't
    need to worry about).
  - Context can be both in the exercise title and in the exercise body
    itself.

- Name the exercises well.  Best is to think of it like a version
  control commit: an imperative sentence stating what the person will
  do in the exercise.  For example:

  ```
  Make your first git commit
  Resolve the conflict
  ```

- In the title, include any other important information (see below):

  ```
  Create a setup.py file for your package (15 min)
  (optional) Install your package in editable mode using ``pip install -e`` (5 min)
  (advanced) Also create packaging using pyproject.toml and compare (20 min)
  ```

- Consider giving your exercises permanent identifiers.  They are
  intentionally not
  auto-numbered yet (what happens when more exercises are
  added/removed?), but if you give them an ID, they will be findable
  even later.  Suggestion is `Episodetopic-N`:

  ```
  Basic-1: Verify git is installed
  Basic-2: Initialize the repository
  Conflicts-2: Create a new branch for the other commit.
  Internals-1: (advanced): Inspect individual objects with ``git cat-file``
  ```

  - It could include not just what you do, but a bit about why you are
    doing it and what you are learning.

- The list includes only `exercise`, `type-along`, and `solution`.  For
  backwards compatibility, `challenge` is also included.

- Optional or advanced exercises should clearly state it in the
  exercise title, since people will browse the list separate from the
  main lesson material.

- Try to minimize use of `:include:` and `:exclude:` and use the
  defaults and adjust your directives to match sphinx-lesson
  semantics.  Excess use of this may over-optimize for particular
  workshops

## Example

**This section contains the exercise list of sphinx-lesson.  Since
sphinx-lesson has many examples of exercises, the list below is
confusing and doesn't make a lot of sense.  You can see a better
example at [git-intro's exercise
list](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/exercises/).**
